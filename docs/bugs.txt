* FIXME: index_textile.txt, 28, % there and on next line produces a span
  tag, something wrong with inline tag handling, which didn't happen
  when Textile was acting recursively on smaller and smaller blocks of
  text and tokenizing them outward
* FIXME: textile.txt, line 99, misjudged list item
* FIXME: textile.txt, line 170, extra CR after alias block

* All blocks need to start with \n\n or at the beginning of the
  buffer.  Oops.
* Oh, I just realized, a line starting with ==> means "literal, but
  float right".  Duh.
* Hey, how come I didn't know about non-greedy regexps until now?
* Tables can't have newlines within cells.  That's wrong, but I don't
  know how the Textile specs deal with that.
* Emacs is just stopping processing of BC's unit tests after about 600
  lines.  Not sure why.
* FIXME: testcases.txt, line 285, blockquote attributes (new bug)
* FIXME: testcases.txt, line 595, interesting - he doesn't change the
  apos
* FIXME: testcases.txt, line 605, failed superscripts (?)
* FIXME: testcases.txt, line 605, nothing changed after that, what
  happened?

old notes on this:

* FIXME: testcases.txt, line 635, not sure I agree with title handling
* FIXME: testcases.txt, line 645, doubled the "caps" span, oops
* FIXME: testcases.txt, line 665, BC skips groups of asterisks greater
*                                 than two
* FIXME: testcases.txt, stopped reading the test results after line 665
