* All blocks need to start with \n\n or at the beginning of the
  buffer.  Oops.
* Oh, I just realized, a line starting with ==> means "literal, but
  float right".  Duh.
* Extended blockquotes are pretty broken.  The extended block code needs
  a rewrite.  Again.
* Emacs is just stopping processing of BC's unit tests after about 600
  lines.  Not sure why.
* FIXME: testcases.txt, line 285, blockquote attributes (new bug)
* FIXME: testcases.txt, line 595, interesting - he doesn't change the
  apos
* FIXME: testcases.txt, line 605, failed superscripts (?)
* FIXME: testcases.txt, line 605, nothing changed after that, what
  happened?

old notes on this:

* FIXME: testcases.txt, line 635, not sure I agree with title handling
* FIXME: testcases.txt, line 645, doubled the "caps" span, oops
* FIXME: testcases.txt, line 665, BC skips groups of asterisks greater
*                                 than two
* FIXME: testcases.txt, stopped reading the test results after line 665
