h1=. Textile for Emacs

Yes, I am implementing "Textile":http://textile.thresholdstate.com/ for
Emacs.

Dean Allen calls the original Textile a "Humane Web Text
Generator"[1]... which basically means that you can learn a simple but
powerful syntax for marking up text, and Textile will turn that into
valid XHTML(Extended Hypertext Markup Language).  See "Brad Choate's
specification":http://bradchoate.com/mt/docs/mtmanual_textile2.html for
a full manual of how the markup works.

At this time textile.el works with GNU(GNU's not Unix) Emacs 21.1 or
later, with full support available for 21.3 and later.  Mule-UCS is
required for 21.1 and 21.2 if you want Unicode entity conversion.
Mule-UCS is not required for Emacs 21.3 or later.  Emacs 22 is the
primary development platform, and the coming Emacs 23 is fully
supported.  Check this page in the future for XEmacs support.

There will be more information here when it's time to release v1.0, as
well as a manual eventually.  We now have a "live demo":test.php running
if you want to try a recent version of textile.el out.  In the meantime,
please look in "the download directory":download/ for the "latest
nightly snapshot":download/textile-latest.tar.gz, check
"ViewCVS":/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/textile/?root=cvs
for the detailed information about development, or get the "latest stable
release":download/textile-stable.tar.gz (which might not have all the
latest features but may be more likely to work as advertised).

I can't stress this enough: if you want this to work, stick with the
latest stable release (currently 0.99.1 above).  New development is
now taking place in textile2.el because I have abandoned the original
as a dead end.

This page is created in textile.el, and should give you some idea of how
well things are working so far.  Don't blame textile.el for my simple
stylesheet.  You can see the original Textile source code for this page
"here":/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/textile/docs/index_textile.txt?root=cvs&view=markup.

textile.el is being released under the GNU General Public License.  It
is being reverse-engineered from the specs and Textile-to-XHTML
generation tools on Dean Allen's and Brad Choate's websites; it is *not*
a port of PHP or Perl code to Emacs Lisp.  I have never laid eyes on the
code for either Textile or MT-Textile.  Dean Allen and Brad Choate are
not responsible for this implementation of Textile in any way, and all
bug reports for the Emacs version need to come to me at csebold+textile
==-at-== gmail.com.

At this point I don't plan to accept suggestions for improvements
(except for actual bug reports) until after 2.0 is released, but feel
free to send me some for consideration after that.

fn1. http://www.textism.com/article/648/textile

fn2. Development will not continue on the 0.99 series.  Use 0.99.1
stable if you need something that works until the 2.0 series is
released.

fn3. This is alpha!  This won't just kick you and take your lunch
money, it will get you drunk, take pictures of you, caption them with
witty "FAIL" sentiments, and post them on the internet.  Use 0.99.1 if
you need something that works for now.  But, this is working
surprisingly well for all that.

h3. Todo

Things left to do before each version is released:

* 1.0 (not going to happen)
* 2.0
** Total rewrite using parser (see docs/engineering.txt for details as
   they become available)
** pass my own text sample tests and correctly handle this page
** pass Brad Choate's test cases, which I received thanks to "Roberto
   De Almeida":http://dealmeida.net/en/Projects/PyTextile/, the
   excellent hacker currently responsible for PyTextile.
** any reported bugfixes
* 2.1
** Texinfo manual
** font-lock settings for Textile text (maybe I'll do that first)
* 2.2 (XEmacs support, if anybody cares)
* 2.3
** w3/w3m integration (I don't remember what that means)
** Gnus/Message integration (yikes, you can send HTML email from Gnus!)

h3{color: red}. Recent news

dl. 28 August 2008:Forget the third alpha release, and go straight for
the fourth alpha "1.99.4":download/textile-1.99.4.tar.gz which is now
available.  Aliases, clear tags, better inline tag support, Unicode
almost handled properly... getting closer to beta!  We have to pass BC's
test cases to be beta, as far as I'm concerned.  Then we'll release new
"stable" versions based on the betas until 2.0.  Next stop is to build a
unit test in Emacs so that I can know exactly where things are going
wrong.
26 August 2008:No real progress on the Textile front, but I did
build a new web server and moved everything to that.
25 August 2008:Second alpha release
"1.99.2":download/textile-1.99.2.tar.gz now available.  Works better
than previous 1.99 versions, but that's not saying much.  Styles are
almost correct again.  Still have aliases and tons of little things to
clean up.
24 August 2008:It works using Emacs 23 from CVS!  Nasty total
rewrite of the "attribute string" code; current CVS is totally
broken.  If you want the new parser, use 1.99.1 for now, otherwise
stick with 0.99.1.  (There are plenty of reasons to use the newer
code, though.)
22 August 2008:First alpha release
"1.99.1":download/textile-1.99.1.tar.gz of what will be the 2.0
series.  Use @textile2.el@ for now until we are passing the unit tests
(or at least more of them).  Lots of things working, but some
surprising breakage.  It's fast and it doesn't require increases to
@max-lisp-eval-depth@, which is a huge win.
14 August 2008:I have given up on the 0.99.x releases.  My efforts
are now going into the total rewrite (that's @textile2.el@ as opposed
to @textile.el@ in CVS right now).  About half the block processing is
finished but we're already doing better in terms of extended blocks
than we were.  I'm developing this with Brad Choate's unit tests in
front of me, so every change gets run against his tests to see what
happens, every time.
12 August 2008:Fixed blockcode bug (for now) and updated my table
of planned releases.  I do plan to get as far as I can in fixing old
bugs before the total rewrite.  It helps me to be even more aware of
what wheels I already invented, four years ago.  Incremental releases
fixing obvious bugs until 0.99.5, then progress through BC's unit
tests until 1.0, then we start all over again.  I'm looking forward to
it.
11 August 2008:Finally resurrected my archives and I'm bringing
textile.el back online!  I hope to actually work on it, too, but we'll
have to see about that.  Also fixed a minor bug, released 0.99.1
(mostly just to have done it), and fixed the DOCTYPE for XHTML 1.1.
15 September 2004:The latest releases from now on are going to be
broken for a few days, because I am rewriting part of the block
handler for the fourth time.  If you want one that mostly works, stick
with CVS v1.137 or final beta release 0.99.0 for now.  I hope to get
back to this in a week or two with something that passes most of Brad
Choate's tests.  Watch this space for a release that works as
expected, but 0.99.0 is good enough for most people's work, I suspect.
7 September 2004:I had hoped to only have one more beta release
before the release candidates started coming out, but it wasn't to
be.  Having received a copy of the test cases for the Perl and Python
ports of Textile, I have discovered that I still wasn't clear on some
aspects of the Textile 2 spec, and there are still quite a few bugs
left, even accounting for my misunderstandings.  So, we're going into
a "final beta" mode for release, but I have no idea how many releases
there will have to be before we clear everything up.  The live demo
helped clear up a few easy bugs.  I have started a new series of
releases, each of which should asymptotically approach a perfect
rendering of all the test cases I have received.  We're starting with
"0.99.0":downloads/textile-0.99.0.tar.gz, which fixes a couple of
showstoppers which were causing Lisp errors.  Whether the 80/20 rule
is valid or not, it certainly appears that my silly table above will
have 1% of the progress requiring 80% of the work.  Oh, and I've
decided that it will be easier to just strive for Textile 2 compliance
in this release, not the next one.
3 September 2004:It isn't pretty, but I have a "live demo of textile.el":test.php
running now.  By the way, the CVS version of textile.el can now be
called in batch mode, will process data fed to it on STDIN, and output
the Textile version when it's done.  Call it something like 
@emacs -batch -l textile.el < my_textile.txt > my_textile.html@ and see
what happens.
3 September 2004:Ninth beta version "0.98":download/textile-0.98.tar.gz
released.  XHTML 1.1 support has been added, and @lang@ attributes are
now converted to @==xml:lang==@ attributes if XHTML 1.1 is being
output.  Note that @textile-header@ now has had a backwards-incompatible
change; the @HTML-VERSION@ argument has been moved after the @TITLE@
element and is now optional.  I have started to do some work on the
manual, and the most basic manual support will probably be there for
1.0, although I still hope to put together a comprehensive Textile
format manual for release 1.5.  I think I will announce this version to
"gnu.emacs.sources":http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=lang_en&ie=UTF-8&safe=off&group=gnu.emacs.sources
early next week and see if I can get more beta testers before 1.0.  Also
fixed a couple of big "thinko's" in tokenizing which were biting me when
creating this @<dl>@ entry.
2 September 2004:Eighth beta version "0.97":download/textile-0.97.tar.gz
released.  W3C(World Wide Web Consortium) is now recognized as an
acronym, as are any acronyms with numbers in them.  Figured out how to
instrument my single Lisp macro, which makes debugging much easier.
Also added a lengthy comment to the beginning of the code explaining how
to actually use textile.el, in preparation for public release.  I'm
considering adding XHTML 1.1 support before the 1.0 release; we'll see
how ambitious I feel later.
1 September 2004:Seventh beta version "0.96":download/textile-0.96.tar.gz released.  Now a raw URL like http://www.bradchoate.com will be converted to an @<a
href>@ link automatically.  I'm about out of things to add to the 1.0
release; I can't think of another feature to add that hasn't been
specified for a later release already.
31 August 2004:Sixth beta version "0.95":download/textile-0.95.tar.gz released.  Now you can evaluate Emacs Lisp expressions, so that
@#@@[((textile-version))]#@ -> "#[((textile-version))]#".  Also, there
are some basic standard header and footer functions so that you can have
an entirely self-hosting Textile-encoded page turn into a valid XHTML
document without too much escaping.  This, however, is not very elegant.
See the source for this page to see how it works.  1.0 looms ever closer.
30 August 2004:Fourth beta version "0.93":download/textile-0.93.tar.gz released.  Fixed a v2 smart-quotes bug -- oh, and this release will actually work
for somebody who isn't actively developing Textile, unlike the last
few.  Oops.  I wrote Dean Allen to ask him if he cared if I called
this "textile.el" but I haven't heard back; I'm sure he's probably too
busy to care whether somebody implements this in Emacs, but I thought
it the polite thing to ask.  I imagine that I will go on calling this
textile.el until I hear otherwise.  In the meantime we are a couple of
minor useability functions away from a 1.0 release.
27 August 2004:Third beta version "0.92":download/textile-0.92.tar.gz released.
All Textile 1 features supported, including handling some unescaped
HTML.  Most Textile 2 features are supported as well.  Barring major
bugs we are perilously close to a 1.0 release; now I need to take the
time to write Dean Allen and ask him if I can call this Textile.  Also
found a way to fix the problem of nested lists not being generated as
valid XHTML.
26 August 2004:Dean Allen's sample text now comes out of textile.el
in a +mostly+ working fashion, including handling some unescaped HTML
(mostly @<pre><code>@ blocks and @<a href>@ tags).
25 August 2004:First beta version "0.9":download/textile-0.9.tar.gz
released.  All Textile 1 features supported except for proper handling
of unescaped HTML; the best way to produce valid HTML with Textile is to
let Textile produce the HTML, no question.  Please send bug reports to
csebold ==-at-== gmail.com.
25 August 2004:Unicode support is working for 21.1 + Mule-UCS, 21.3, and 21.4 CVS versions of GNU Emacs.  Fixed a bug caused by a "change in the default behavior of split-string":http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/emacs/emacs/lisp/subr.el.diff?r1=1.353&r2=1.354.  How frustrating.
25 August 2004:All inline Textile tags are now processed while other
things (that would have broken up the string into a string tree) have
been tokenized, which will hopefully cause our bug from yesterday not to
rear its ugly head.  In the meantime the code is screaming to be
refactored again, but I may just release 1.0 before I start working on
that; the manual is starting to become really important to me.  I still
have to fix Unicode support, but then a 0.9 beta release should be ready
to go.
