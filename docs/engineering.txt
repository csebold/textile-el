In version 2 of textile.el, we are going to do a full rewrite.  The idea
is to create a table of textile tags and what effect they have (perhaps
that will be just a function name, much like what we have now), which
can be compiled at load-time into a regexp.  Same with a table of style
codes.

Then we make a parsing system that works, and we can plug other kinds of
markup into it.
