p((<>[11](my_class). This is a Textile test.

h1. This is a first-level header.

(list1)#(#listid1) This is the first entry in my ordered list[1].
#(listclass2) This is the second.

# This should be the first entry in a new ordered list.
# This should be the second.
(#unordered)** The third entry is a nested list.
** See how I just mix and match lists?
**{color: red} This is supposed to be a v2 feature.
# And this should be the third.

* This is a single-item unordered list.

* What if a list
* of some length
* has a line
which starts with no list item tag
* and yet finishes with one?

h2. Textile v1 image tests:

!http://www.livingtorah.org/images/a.gif!

Here is !http://www.livingtorah.org/images/a.gif (an inline image)! to see if that works.

And finally, here is !http://a.com/b.gif (a normal image)! and !http://a.com/c.gif (a linked image)!:ltm which is linked to an alias, no less.

h2. Textile v2 image tests:

!http://a.com/b.gif 30x40!

!http://a.com/b.gif 30w 40h!

!{border: 0px}http://a.com/b.gif 30x40 (with a title)!:ltm

h2. Textile link tests:

OK, "here is a link":http://www.livingtorah.org to my website.

"Here is a link":http://www.livingtorah.org, and "here's another":http://www.livingtorah.org.

Let's try aliases: "here":ltm is the ministry link, and "here":ltj is the journal.

And then "a normal link (Sun)":http://www.sun.com to Sun's website.

And a "link including an ampersand":http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/test?a=b&c=d, which would also be a good way to see if the URL-finding code knows where to stop.

Will thís be cônverted to Unicode, or at least entities?

Here are the inline tests: We have a *strong* and an _emphasized,_ a **bold,** an __italics,__ a ++bigger,++ a --smaller,-- something -deleted,- something +inserted,+ some ^superscript,^ some ~subscript,~ a %{color: red}red span,% and @some code, including something like 2>&1 and _non-emphasized text_.@  And here's some ==*escaped text*== just to see what happens.  Here's some ??cited text?? also.

Now, strong*things*embedded shouldn't work, but strong[*things embedded in braces*]should work.

What about _emphasized text with some *strong* text within it?_

*_And what about something right at the beginning of a line?_*  Hm, what about that?  This isn't a list item, is it?

And let's not forget that we should be able to _(emphasize things in parentheses without it trying to turn that into a style)._

p)>. This should be a paragraph, floated right and padded on the right by 1 em.

bq. This is a blockquote.
I am going to cut it into small lines
With their own line breaks.

clear.

dl. term:definition
block:not usually something like this,
and here's a line break to make things really interesting
term with spaces:the definition should be self-evident
finally:a last definition to see if it works

|This is a simple table.|
>|Here is a cell that
has a newline character in it.  Yikes.|
|I hope that this works.|

table(#table1). _|row 1, col 1|row 1, col 2|
|\2. row 2, cols 1-2|
|/2. rows 3-4, col 1|row 3, col 2|
|row 4, col 2|
|^. row 5, col 1|~. row5, col 2|

table(tbl1). (head)|_. column 1 |_.      column 2 |_>.     column 3 |
                   |   1        |        2        |(test).        3 |
                   |   4        |(#foo). 5        |               6 |
                   |   7        |        8        |(test#bar).    9 |

bc.. This is code
  Which you can see is a little bit
    indented and tells us that 2>1
      And that 1 & 2 < 4 but I'm going to hardcode an &amp; in here.
    Do you think this will work?

  Look, more indented code!
    It's supposed to stop before the next escape block.

==
<p>This is supposed to be escaped text.  I should be able to do [1] in here with no problems, as well as other weird things.</p>

bq. Like this.

h3. Or this.
==

h3))>. This is a third-level header.

1. And this is just a paragraph that starts with a number, perhaps in an ill-advised attempt to begin a list?

h7. This is a mistake[42].

bq>.. And here is a lengthier piece that actually contains what we would think of as an extended block.

This is also covered as part of the previous extended block.

p. And this is a normal paragraph again.

fn1. This is my first footnote.

fn42. This is my forty-second.
