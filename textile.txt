p((<>[11](my_class). This is a Textile test.

h1. This is a first-level header.

(list1)#(#listid1) This is the first entry in my ordered list[1].
#(listclass2) This is the second.

# This should be the first entry in a new ordered list.
# And this should be the second.

* This is a single-item unordered list.

p)>. This should be a paragraph, floated right and padded on the right by 1 em.

bq. This is a blockquote.
I am going to cut it into small lines
With their own line breaks.

clear.

dl. term:definition
block:not usually something like this,
and here's a line break to make things really interesting
term with spaces:the definition should be self-evident

1. And this is just a paragraph that starts with a number, perhaps in an ill-advised attempt to begin a list?

h7. This is a mistake[42].

bq>.. And here is a lengthier piece that actually contains what we would think of as an extended block.

This is also covered as part of the previous extended block.

p. And this is a normal paragraph again.

fn1. This is my first footnote.

fn42. This is my forty-second.
