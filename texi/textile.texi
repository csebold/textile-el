This manual is for textile.el v1.0, which is an implementation of
Textile and MT-Textile in Emacs Lisp.  Textile is described by its
creator as a ``Humane Web Text Generator,'' which means that a person
can learn a few simple rules and markup a text document which will
then be transformed into @acronym{XHTML} that is valid,
typographically competent, and visually as pleasing to the eye as
modern style sheets and browsers will allow.

@cindex valid
@cindex smart quotes
@cindex CMS

This will explain why a person would want to use Textile, and why I
implemented Textile in Emacs Lisp.  This will also include some of the
history of the markup standard.

Textile is described by its creator as a ``Humane Web Text
Generator,''@footnote{@uref{http://www.textism.com/article/648/textile}}
which means that a person can learn a few simple rules and markup a
text document which will then be transformed into @acronym{XHTML} that
is valid, typographically competent, and visually as pleasing to the
eye as modern style sheets and browsers will allow.

I believe that Dean Allen described Textile as ``humane'' because the
process of creating valid, pleasing XHTML has usually been a fairly
unhappy one.  The average @acronym{HTML} author doesn't even write his
or her own code; they tend to use @acronym{WYSIWYG} tools to produce
HTML.  Most of those tools do not produce (X)HTML that conforms to the
@acronym{W3C} standard, much less the @acronym{SGML} or @acronym{XML}
standards.  The authors who know some HTML usually don't make sure
that they are outputting valid HTML, which means that the elements of
the page may not be rendered as expected, since browsers then have to
guess at what the HTML author meant to do.  Having to process invalid
HTML is referred to by many as ``tag soup,'' since once cannot be sure
that there is a valid structure at all when one element fails.

If you are a text-oriented person, you may have simply wanted to be
able to write what you wanted, and then apply a few layout or
typographical changes to make the result more correct or more
aesthetically pleasing.  But let's say I wanted to write a paragraph
which was not tied to the left (the usual default) but floated to the
right, padded on the left by
2em@footnote{an @code{em} space is the width of a capital ``M''}, and
with other changes applied by the @acronym{CSS} class ``mypar.''  In
XHTML I would have to do it this way:

@example
<p style="float: right; padding-left: 2em;" class="mypar">How can
anybody remember all those different tags, and what they represent?
Is it even possible?</p>
@end example

Note the things I have to remember:  I have to enclose the paragraph
in @code{<p>} tags, I have to insert manual CSS commands to float the
paragraph and pad it (but only on the left, not everywhere), and I
have to determine the class.

Imagine if you knew a simpler syntax, in which blocks are defined by
code whenever you start them, and you don't have to remember to flank
them on both sides.  You have a few simple rules, like ``things in
parentheses are classes and IDs.''  The Textile code below produces
the XHTML code you saw above:

@example
p((>(mypar). How can anybody remember all those different tags, and
what they represent?  Is it even possible?
@end example

Here is a better example.  Would you rather do this when you want to
link to an image:

@example
<img src="/images/screenshot.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
@end example

@dots{}or this:

@example
!/images/screenshot.jpg 640x480!
@end example

More importantly for some, do you know the difference between smart
quotes and --- well, uneducated quotes?  Do you know how to turn
dashes into em-dashes and en-dashes?  Usually you have to have a
Unicode table nearby to input the proper Unicode entities so that
browsers will display these symbols uniformly, and you have to
painstakingly go through all your code to change @code{"quote"} to
@code{&#8220;quote&#8221;} and then everything just looks like a big
mess when you're done.  Textile can do this for you,
semi-intelligently.  Most people would have difficulty when faced with
the choice of concentrating on writing versus concentrating on valid
markup.  Textile may free you from markup so you can focus on writing
intelligently.  And that, I'm sure you'll agree, would make the web a
much better place.

Originally Dean Allen wrote Textile as a markup for use in his
@acronym{CMS} called ``Textpattern.''  Additionally he put up a page
where you could see what the markup
did@footnote{@uref{http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/}}, and people
started trying it out.  Previously most text-to-HTML tools used a Wiki
syntax which was handy but not full-featured enough, or just a simple
algorithm to attempt to break paragraphs up in @code{<p>} tags.
Again, you can see why Dean considered this to be ``humane,'' compared
to what was out there.

The popularity of Textile seemed to explode after Brad Choate ported
Dean's PHP code to Perl and released it as a
plug-in@footnote{@uref{http://bradchoate.com/mt/docs/mtmanual_textile2.html}}
for Movable Type, a non-free but very popular CMS also written in
Perl.  Soon afterward, Brad cooperated with Dean to extend the format
to include more tags, more XHTML support, and stranger markup
situations.  Brad then relied on another piece of software,
SmartyPants by John
Gruber@footnote{@uref{http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/}},
to ``educate'' the quotes and punctuation.

In the months that followed, Brad's code was ported back to PHP by
others wishing to use it with free CMS's, and nearly every free or
open-source server-side web text processor had or would soon get a
Textile-to-XHTML generator.

And soon after that, I decided that I wanted to author HTML in Textile
but not use a server-side CMS to serve it.

@node Why Textile for Emacs,  , Why Textile, Why
@section Why Textile for Emacs

Here is my short list of reasons for reverse-engineering Textile in
Emacs:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Because everything should be able to run under Emacs
@item
Because I don't want to edit text using the @code{<textarea>} form
fields in a web browser; I have a perfectly good text editor already
@item
Because sometimes I can't install Textile on somebody else's CMS, but
I can always install Textile on my copy of Emacs
@item
Because I wanted to take on a bigger project in Emacs Lisp than I ever
had before, and I needed the release during a stressful time in my
life; who has fun coding in C anyway?  And somebody far more competent
than I@footnote{@uref{http://diveintomark.org/projects/pytextile/}}
already ported it to Python.
@item
Because it keeps making me consider writing an entire CMS in Emacs
Lisp, which I will never do but which keeps me awake some nights
thinking about how easy it would be with tramp and ange-ftp in the
shape they're in
@item
Because I couldn't think of a better way to really learn XHTML
@item
Because I have an evil idea, which is to add this to Message mode in
Gnus and be able to send well-formatted HTML email, something which is
actually useful once in a great while
@item
Because I have a side project coming in which I convert BetaCode (an
ancient Greek @acronym{ASCII} encoding) to Unicode entities on the
fly, and already having this in place makes that a lot easier

@chapter Using textile

@cindex using

To use textile.el, put this file into your load path, and put the
following into your @file{.emacs} file:

@lisp
(require 'textile)
@end lisp

At this time Textile markup is only documented at
@uref{http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/} and
@uref{http://bradchoate.com/mt/docs/mtmanual_textile2.html}, so to
understand how to write Textile code, for now you should check those
web sites.  In the future this manual will detail the format that
comes with textile.el.

In a buffer with Textile markup, you can run:

@example
@kbd{M-x textile-buffer @key{RET}}
@end example

and have the entire buffer processed by Textile, which (by default)
will create a new buffer with valid XHTML markup in it.  If you want
the returned XHTML in the same buffer as the old code, you can change
@code{textile-output-to-new-buffer} to @code{nil} (it defaults to
@code{t}).  You can also call @code{textile-region} in similar
fashion.  If you want to use textile.el in your own Emacs Lisp
programs, you can pass a string to @code{textile-string} and it will
return XHTML in another string.

@end menu

@node Newlines, Bug Reports, Using textile, Using textile
@section Newlines

@cindex newline
@cindex carriage return
@cindex cr
@cindex br

Standard Textile behavior is to treat newlines in the middle of a
block (like a paragraph) as intentional newlines, and it replaces them
with @code{<br />} when it sees them.  To change this behavior so that
you can edit Textile text with @code{auto-fill-mode} on, you can
either load @file{longlines.el} (found elsewhere) or you can put the
following into your @file{.emacs} file:

@lisp
(setq textile-br-all-newlines nil)
@end lisp

This will change @code{textile-br-all-newlines} to @code{nil} (it
defaults to @code{t}).

For example, if we start with the following Textile markup:

@example
bq. The rain in Spain
Falls mainly
On the plain.
@end example

With @code{textile-br-all-newlines} set to the default @code{t}, we
see this output:

@example
<blockquote><p>The rain in Spain<br />
Falls mainly<br />
On the plain.</p></blockquote>
@end example

Since this paragraph is actually a sort of poetic doggerel, it is
appropriate to break the lines there.  If we have it set to
@code{nil}, the result is this:

@example
<blockquote><p>The rain in Spain
Falls mainly
On the plain.</p></blockquote>
@end example

This doesn't look so bad in HTML, but now imagine how your web browser
will parse and display this:

@display
The rain in Spain Falls mainly On the plain.
@end display

Notice that this looks like a normal quotation, and the capitalization
is very weird because ``Falls'' and ``On'' are in the middle of the
ordinary sentence.  If this is what you wanted, then that's fine, but
it might surprise you sometimes.

If you have @code{textile-br-all-newlines} set to @code{nil} but we
still want line breaks, we have to put them in manually:

@example
bq. The rain in Spain<br />
Falls mainly<br />
On the plain.
@end example

This produces the desired effect, but now you are mixing Textile and
HTML and that can be a dangerous combination.  There is no guarantee
that some future revision of Textile might not decide to convert your
raw @code{<br />} tags to entities, and you may end up with a literal
``<br />'' in your finished output.  Then you would have to escape it
by surrounding it with @code{==} to be sure that it works:

@example
bq. The rain in Spain ==<br />==
Falls mainly ==<br />==
On the plain.
@end example

The extra space before the @code{==}, which won't be visible in your
output in all likelihood, is to guarantee that Textile recognizes the
@code{==} as an inline escape; otherwise it might think that you are
doing math.  As you can see, this is getting fairly ugly.  It is much
easier to just take the default.

In short, it is hard to guarantee that textile.el will always do the
right thing if you change @code{textile-br-all-newlines}, and you may
find it difficult in some cases to enter a manual linebreak unless you
escape it with @code{==}; the best thing to do is either edit without
@code{auto-fill-mode} or use longlines, but I will try to keep
@code{textile-br-all-newlines} working as expected when possible
(because I like @code{auto-fill-mode}).
